## What Each Team Member Does
- Create a branch called "branch-yourname"
- Add a new file, and make a change to it, or make a change to an existing file
- merge the code to main
- push up your branch
- pull down the current changes from github
- push up main to github
- Wait till everyone in the team has pushed up their first branch, then do steps 1-6 a second time, with your branch being called "branch-yourname-2"
